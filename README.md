Voronoi Postcodes MapIt
=======================

This repository is for a version of MapIt which contains
postcode boundaries calculated from the Voronoi diagram of
postcode centroids in ONSPD.

For more information see the blog post here:

If you're looking to create a MapIt in your country, work on any
of the underlying code, or re-use it as an app in another Django
project, you probably want https://github.com/mysociety/mapit
instead.
